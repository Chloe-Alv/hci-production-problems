          Fjalla One is apart of the Sans Serif and was carefully
          adjusted to the restrictions of the screen. However,
          Fjalla One is not very verstile, which is one of its biggest
          disadvantage. Despite this, Fjalla One has the ability grab a
          reader's attention with its boldness, which makes it great for
          headings. Noto Sans is a global font that can be used to write
          in all modern and anciet lanugages. Noto is also very verstile by
          having multiple italic styles, weights and widths.

        <h2>Why Noto Sans and Fjalla One?</h2>
        <p>
          These two simply embrace eachother by their differences in weight, scale, and width.
          Paired together, a reader can clearly see the differences in hierarchy and together, they
          can used to break down longer text. With Fjalla One being a great for headings and
          subheadings, with Noto Sans being great for any body of text.
