## ITMD 362, Production Problem 02: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site
Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Before you start, be sure to read through the color theory readings on the course calendar for Week
Four.

Once you’ve read, you’ll choose a palette based on each prompt below, and paste the Paletton URL in
with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the `uid` value in the Paletton URL changes with each
adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the colors you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode “Default with Text,” so you can see how text looks on each palette
you choose. Use the Preview tab at the bottom of the palette preview.

1. A **monochromatic color palette** for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kzGsW0oHNmpL6CqnmJmgq
Your Rationale: I decided to choose red as the base color for this palette because when you think of the color red, one becomes excited and energetic. Thus, since this a site introducing a new console gaming platform will invoke these emotions and help hype a viewer for this new console. I made sure to put white in the palette because it works as a great background color but the second color also works well because one see can black and white text and its not too distracting to read text. While the second color will work great as a headlines or titles.

2. An **adjacent color palette** for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL:  http://paletton.com/#uid=53B0L1ki-++0E++cJ+ZnY+XtQZNkhd+TumC5bd+Ym-+As3YEkv3mRbbx+o8rDHyhfVJ9l
Your Rationale: I choose a lighter blue as a base color because I feel like light blue gives a sense of calmness, and from my experience going to the Botanical Gardens, there is a sense of calmness when seeing plants. Also, I felt like a light blue would make a great background color and is not too harsh where it hurts the eye on the screen. Plus, I saw that it worked well with black, grey, and white text. I choose lavender because I associate this color with springtime, which works well for announcing springtime tours. I chose the darker green because I associate darker greens with earthiness, but I didn't want to make the green too dark where it did not pair well with the lighter blue and purple. Plus, the darker green would be great as a header color.

3. A **triadic color palette** for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet
